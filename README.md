# scalableRandomMazeGenerator

This is a Maze generator and race game.

IT uses a non-traditional maze generating algorithm that I made, which makes a random line from one side of the map to the other, than slowly branches out with a tree-like pattern. Although less optimal, it produces a nice, unpredictable maze, unlike the recursive division method. 

Scalable from a 2x2 to 200x200 maze, using boolean adjacency matrices to store values of connecting paths. 

Turned into a endless two player racing game, making use of recursive design and procedural generation.

A similar algorithim is used in UpChuck for its map generation.
